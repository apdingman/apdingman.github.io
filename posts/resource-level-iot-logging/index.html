Are you managing a fleet of devices on AWS IoT Core? If so, you likely know that the CloudWatch log group AWSIotLogsV2 can be your best friend for troubleshooting connectivity issues between devices and the IoT core broker. Scraping through logs in this log group can highlight some key information about the successes/failures of your device’s connectivity like seen in Figure 1."><meta name=author content="Adam Dingman"><link rel=canonical href=https://apdingman.github.io/posts/resource-level-iot-logging/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.bc1149f4a72aa4858d3a9f71462f75e5884ffe8073ea9d6d5761d5663d651e20.css integrity="sha256-vBFJ9KcqpIWNOp9xRi915YhP/oBz6p1tV2HVZj1lHiA=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><script defer crossorigin=anonymous src=/assets/js/highlight.f413e19d0714851f6474e7ee9632408e58ac146fbdbe62747134bea2fa3415e0.js integrity="sha256-9BPhnQcUhR9kdOfuljJAjlisFG+9vmJ0cTS+ovo0FeA=" onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
