# About Me

IoT architect with experience across consulting, high-growth organizations (through an IPO), and well-established manufacturers.

Motivated by working with systems that are or soon will operate at tremendous scale and that have a direct human impact.

Equally engaged by conversation around technical design, business objectives, or how to attract, grow, and retain the best talent.

Domains I’m passionate about:

- Internet of Things (IoT)
- Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)
- Fleet Management / Over the Air Firmware Updates (OTA)
- DevOps
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Serverless Architectures
- API Development
- Monitoring, Alerting, Logging, and other instrumentation systems

Favorite AWS Services

- AWS Lambda
- Amazon API Gateway
- AWS IoT Core

A few of the principles I subscribe to:

- Extreme Ownership
- Iterate fast. Talk about the details after you’ve built v1.
- Always be learning
